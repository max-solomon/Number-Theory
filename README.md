# Number-Theory
A bunch of programs written both as Python exercises and to better understand math classes I was taking at the time.
Many of the algorithms are nowhere near optimal, but they do mostly work. I will try to optimize most of them eventually.
This was mostly inspired by material from the AMAT 326 Classical Algebra and AMAT 425 Number Theory classes at SUNY Albany.
